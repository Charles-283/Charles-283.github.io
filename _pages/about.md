I'm a second year Mphil student from [Microelectronics Thrust](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/zh/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/function-hub/microelectronics/), [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology(Guang Zhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/). My research interest includes Model compression, software-hardware co-design for AI, GPU acceleration, AI chip design.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Xinyu Chen of [CLab Lab](https://soldierchen.github.io/), HKUST(GZ). I was advised by Prof. Yi Zou from SCUT.

You can find my CV here: [Huangxu's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Huangxu_Chen-Resume.pdf).
